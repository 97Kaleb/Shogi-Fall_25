# Overview

This is a rudimentary app that allows two people to play shogi, a Japanese variant of chess.

The reaon I wrote this was twofold: first, I wanted to learn how to develop for Android using Kotlin. Second, I really like shogi, and figured that it was a tough enough project to teach me most of what I needed to know to begin working on other projects in the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This software was written in Kotlin in Android Studio using Compose. Gemini was used for assistance in learning to use Compose, as well as for help in bugfixing.
